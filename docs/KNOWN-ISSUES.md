This file tracks open runtime issues only. Fixed issues are recorded in
[CHANGELOG.md](../CHANGELOG.md), and the roadmap and backlog live in the
repository's issue tracker.

## Open

### Street traffic can be slow/uneven when panning across dense city blocks
Status: Open (partially mitigated)

Context:
- Current traffic loader fetches one clamped viewport tile at a time (major pass, then full pass).
- In dense cores, some visible roads can appear late after city jumps or fast pans.
- Zooming into adjacent streets does not always immediately trigger higher-detail coverage for all visible roads.

Current mitigation in runtime:
- Fair per-road dot budget allocation (reduces hard starvation under global `MAX_DOTS` cap).
- Center-shift threshold (reduces stale overlap lock while panning).

Next iteration candidates:
- Prioritize currently visible road segments inside the active viewport before off-center segments.
- Add neighbor prefetch ring for nearby tiles after jump-to-city actions.
- Add adaptive dot cap by frame time (coverage first, density second).
- Promote sync chip from loading indicator to true multi-phase progress.

### Height-datum residuals
Status: Open (accepted 2026-07-08)

Entity heights go through the geoid correction in `src/data/geoid.js` and
are floored against the rendered terrain. Two residuals remain:

- **Cold-start floor latency:** at a freshly-visited airport, grounded/low aircraft
  float low for ~1–2 poll cycles (30–60 s) and rise as terrain floors resolve;
  a few stragglers take one more poll.
- **Born-grounded first poll:** a contact first seen on the ground with no altitude
  data renders at the geoid for ≤1 poll until its floor cell warms.

`scripts/qa-floor-verify.mjs` is the verification oracle for floor placement.
